# Welcome to the T-R-E-K App!

Choose your own adventure! The Trek app is designed to be a single stop app for planning a day's outing. Plan out a route to a nearby hiking spot, then find local restaurants and shops to stop at along the way.

## App Functionality

The app is designed to be simple to use. Enter your starting address, and enter how far you would like to travel to a hiking spot. Decide whether or not you'd like to shop or eat along the way. The app will give you a list of directions and a map to help guide you. Weather conditions will let you know what to expect on the hike.

### App Design, Goals, and Future Direction

Now, on to some technical details of the T-R-E-K app. In order to present the user with relevant information, the app pulls data from several different API databases. Among these are several Google Maps APIs, the Hiking Project API, the Yelp Fusion API, and the PLACEHOLDER WEATHER api. Asynchronous JavaScript and jQuery functions are used to gather relevant results for the user, and the app interface is designed to present all this information in a single place. Overall, the program is an excellent demonstration of the power of using databases to gather and consolidate information from disparate services. Additional functionality and improvements could be made, however. For example, the Google Maps API services offers a wide variety of options and parameters that could be implemented. These include additional embedded map functionality, the ability to include multiple destinations, and the ability to select multiple modes of transportation. TODO Yelp API... Weather... Hiking...
