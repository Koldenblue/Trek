1.	We could do an app that combines yelp review data with travel time from traffic apis or the google maps api. So for example, a user could search "5 star pizza place within 5 minutes walking" and get a list. And then use the facebook api to post "I'm getting pizza". Or use the foursquare api to find out if any of your friends got pizza there.

2.	Nasa pictures API + space music + getty images api  for even more pictures

3.	Indeed + linkedIn APIs

5.	Find artist info through social media APIs â€“ Instagram, facebook, etc.
